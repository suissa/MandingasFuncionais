## Boas práticas

### Evitar o uso de `switch`


> There are multiple issues with switch, from its procedural control flow to its non-standard-looking way it handles code blocks, the rest of JavaScript uses curly braces yet switch does not. Syntactically, it’s not one of JavaScript’s best, nor is its design. We’re forced to manually add break; statements within each case, which can lead to difficult debugging and nested errors further down the case should we forget! Douglas Crockford has written and spoken about it numerous times, his recommendations are to treat it with caution.
